# DSA - data structures & algorithms in JS

## contents -

1. basic coding challenges - using prebuilt data strucuture, looping & conditional statement etc

2. Recursion - undeserstanding, implementing, & solving some problems using it

3. big O - understanding time & space complexity of the algorithm and estimatimating it's best case & worst case etc

4. Hash table, Maps, Sets - understating prebuilt hash table, map & set data structure and implementing our own version of it

5. Stacks, Oueues, LinkedList - undestanding custom data strucutures & thier properties and implementing each of them

6. Binary Trees, Binary Search Tree, Graphs -

- understanding trees, binary tree data strucuture, it's properties & then it's implemention

  - DFS - depth first traversal
  - BFS - breadth first traversal

- understanding binary search tree BST data strucuture, it's properties & then it's implementation

- Graph data strucutre: understanding it & it's properties, and its implementation using adjacency list or adjacency matrix

7. Sorting Algorithm - sorting unsorted array into sorted array using various sorting algorithms.
   And understing each one's proterties, pros & cons in big O

- bubble sort
- insertion sort
- selection sort
- merge sort
- quick sort
